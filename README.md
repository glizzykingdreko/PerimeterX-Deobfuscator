# Perimeter X Deobfuscator

This is a quick personal project to deobfuscate the Perimeter X main file. It is not perfect, but it works for the most part.
Was needed a quick solution. It works for the base file but isn't designed for the captcha file.

## Usage

```bash
node main.js <file> <output>
```
